[EDIT]: Please ignore all the "Expected Output"s in Part 2 (in Tensorflow section). It is possible that there was a typo propagating there in Part 2. You need to submit your own, correct code without considering those expected outputs given in Part 2. 

In this assignment, you will build functions used in ConvNets and use ConvNets for classification. Download the attached zip file (pa3-conv-nets-withTF.zip). NOTE THAT for the second file, you will need to install tensorflow on your computer first.

Check https://www.tensorflow.org/install/ (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. for installing TensorFlow on your system.
I recommend installing CPU version if you are running the code on your laptop and if you do not want to deal with installing CUDA drivers, (or if you do not have a GPU supporting CUDA platform in your computer).
As described in the class, we will use Jupyter environment in this assignment too. As usual, attached .zip file includes two Jupyter notebooks (two Jupyter files): Namely:

1) p1_conv-nets-step-by-step.ipynb

This file does NOT require tensorflow installation. I recommend you focus on completing this assignment before the midterm.

2) p2_cnns-applications.ipynb

This file requires tensorflow installed on your system. You can start working on this file after the midterm. 

 

Each file has multiple exercises in them and they will be graded individually.
If your code is not giving the correct answer for a particular exercise, you will not receive any point from that particular exercise.
