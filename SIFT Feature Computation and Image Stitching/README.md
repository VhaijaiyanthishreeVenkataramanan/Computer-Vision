In this assignment, you will use OpenCV libraries to compute SIFT features. Due date for this assignment is: Nov 20 11:59pm. (But we can push that back until the 22nd, 11:59pm. Happy Thanksgiving! ).

In particular, you will load two images, and then by matching the computed SIFT features on both images, you will stitch the given two images. First, download the attached zip file (PA5.zip). In this assignment, there is only one Jupyter notebook containing 5 exercises in total.

 

If you prefer, you can run the Jupyter notebook on Google Colab as well. If you choose to run the code on Colab, then you will need to set the variable useGoogleColab to 1 in the first cell. 
if you are running the notebook on your own system, you may need to run the following three commands before starting the Jupyter notebook first:
pip install opencv-python==3.4.2.16
pip install opencv-contrib-python==3.4.2.16
pip install imutils
As described in the class, we will use Jupyter environment in this assignment too. As usual, attached .zip file includes two Jupyter notebooks (two Jupyter files): Namely:

1) SIFTPanoramicImageStitching.ipynb

This file requires particular openCV  version to run properly. If you experience OpenCV related errors, please run the above mentioned 3 pip commands in your system first. 

If your code is not giving the correct answer for a particular exercise, you may not receive any point from that particular exercise.
