In this assignment you will use Jupyter Notebook and run several useful Python commands on basic datasets. Download the attached zip file.

As described in the class, we will use Jupyter environment to run Python. Attached .zip file includes two Jupyter notebooks (two Jupyter files): Namely:

1) 01_python-basics-with-numpy.ipynb

2) 02_logistic-regression.ipynb

Each file will be worth 50% of the total assignment points. 

Each file has multiple exercises in them and they will be graded individually.
If your code is not giving the correct answer for a particular exercise, you will not receive any point from that particular exercise.
