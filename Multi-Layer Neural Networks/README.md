In this assignment, you will build a multi-layer neural network. Download the attached zip file (PA2_CAP5415_V1.zip).

As described in the class, we will use Jupyter environment in this assignment too. Attached .zip file includes two Jupyter notebooks (two Jupyter files): Namely:

1) 01_step-by-step--building-a-deep-network.ipynb

2) 02_applying-a-dnn.ipynb

You will first complete running the first file ( 01_step-by-step--building-a-deep-network.ipynb) since in that file, you are required to build helper files which will help you understand the steps of training a neural network. Then, you will use those implemented helper files in the second part (in the second file) to build a deep neural network. 

Each file has multiple exercises in them and they will be graded individually.
If your code is not giving the correct answer for a particular exercise, you will not receive any point from that particular exercise.
